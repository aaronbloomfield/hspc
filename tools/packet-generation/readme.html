<p>This PHP script is meant to allow users to enter their problem information through a web form. To the submitter, it provides a link to the PDF of just that problem. To the admins, there is a packet.pdf file that contains all of the submitted problems. It does not allow loading of previously submitted problems. Submitting a problem with the same problem ID is effectively an edit, since it replaces the old problem with the same ID (the old one is saved).</p>
<p>The PHP script will write all output to a problems/ sub-directory -- that directory must exist and be writable by the web server. There must also be an problems/old/ directory as well -- upon an edit (submitting a new problem with the same problem ID -- the old one is moved to the old/ directory.</p>
<p>This was developed on an Ubuntu 16.04 system. It requires pandoc and pdflatex to be installed (and possibly some pdflatex packages).</p>
<p>To use it for your institution, you will want to make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change institution-logo.png to your logo; it is currently a modified version of the SIGCSE 2018 logo</li>
<li>Set the balloon colors at the top of packet.php</li>
<li>Change some values in template.tex (lines 8-12)</li>
<li>Make any changes to intro.tex as desired</li>
</ul>
