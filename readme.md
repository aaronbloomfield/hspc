High School Programming Contest Guide
=====================================

This [repository](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/hspc), and the
[viewable website](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/hspc), were
created for the 2018 SIGCSE Workshop entitled, "Organizing a High
School Programming Contest" (workshop #306).  This material is being
made publiclly available to help people who did not attend the
workshop.

### Repository Contents

There are a number of parts to this repo

- [Workshop slides](slides.html#/): the slides used in the workshop presentation given in the SIGCSE 2018 workshop given on February 23, 2018
- [HSPC Guide](guide/hspcguide.pdf): a text document (from the LaTeX source in the [guilde/](guide/) directory) that discusses how to run such a contest
    - This guide includes an example VirtualBox setup
- [Tools](tools/readme.html) ([md](tools/readme.md)): a series of tools (mostly bash scripts) to help handle various aspects of contest coordination
    - Some are ready, and the others will be ready soon (spring 2018)
- [Welcome presentation](welcome.html#/): a welcome presentation, with contest rules; it needs significant customization for a given contest
- [Programming cheat sheets](cheatsheets/): a series of programming language references for [C](cheatsheets/c-cheatsheet.pdf), [C++](cheatsheets/cpp-cheatsheet.pdf), [Java](cheatsheets/java-cheatsheet.pdf), and [Python](cheatsheets/python-cheatsheet.pdf); the source files are in that directory as well
- [PC$^2$ version 9.5.3 documentation](misc/pc2v9AdminGuide.pdf), which was the version used in the workshop; the latest version can be found [here](https://pc2.ecs.csus.edu/pc2docs.html)
- The materials for UVa's 2017 HSPC, which was used in the workshop: the [contest problems](misc/uva-hspc-2017-contest.pdf), the [full set of solutions and judging data](misc/uva-hspc-2017-problems.zip), and the [scoreboard](misc/uva-hspc-2017-scoreboard.html)
- The PC$^2$ system itself was not included in this repo, but can be downloaded [here](https://pc2.ecs.csus.edu/pc2code.html)

Room: 316

This workshop will show participants how to host a successful
programming competition aimed at high school students, and will also
be broadly applicable to collegiate level competitions. These contests
encourage high school students to major in computer science and can
have a positive effect on the recruitment for the host institution. In
addition, our anecdotal evidence has shown a high participation rate
from under-represented groups at such contests. Running a successful
contest, however, is a challenging endeavor. With potentially hundreds
of people attending – both students and coaches – there are many
logistical issues to address. Beyond that, generating an appropriate
problem set and ensuring the contest submission system that runs
smoothly are critical to a successful event. A poorly run contest can
do more harm than good, as the participants will leave with a negative
view of the contest, the institution, and possibly even the field. The
workshop will cover problem generation and submission system usage, as
well as provide discussions and handouts covering all the logistical
aspects for hosting such a high school contest. Documentation covering
all aspects of the contest will be provided to participants. The
workshop organizers include a faculty advisor, a high school coach,
and a former student who both participated in – and later ran – the
contest. At least one organizer has been in every one of the roles in
this type of contest. We have successfully run seven such contests,
with the last four having 200 high school contestants.
